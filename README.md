dbSNP (short for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database) is a publicly available database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
It provides comprehensive information about single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic variations in various organisms, including humans.

The main purpose of dbSNP is to collect and organize genetic variations in the form of SNPs, short insertion/deletions (indels), and other types of genetic variation. These variations are crucial for understanding genetic diversity, disease susceptibility, and personalized medicine. 

Task1: pull SNP data from NIH to azure Cloud environment.

Task 2: Validate the data for proper format JSON data.

Task 3: Once validated this data would be stored in SQL DB
