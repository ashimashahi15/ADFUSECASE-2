Azure Functions
Azure Functions (from Microsoft Azure) is a cloud-based serverless service that allows running event-triggered code in a scalable way without providing or
managing infrastructure. It enables the capability to run a script or piece of code in response to a variety of events and doesnâ€™t need to run continuously.

The most common use cases of Azure Functions include:

Reminders and notifications
Scheduled tasks and messages
File processing
Data or data streams processing
Running background backup tasks
Computing backend calculations
Lightweight Web APIs, proofs of concept, MVPs
